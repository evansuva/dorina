Dorina Evans &mdash; Publications

<p class="dorina">
Whoa!  I've only been here just over a year and I'm supposed to have
learned my research area and finished some publications already?
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Yes, the grad handbook clearly states that students should be able
to develop a solid research proposal by the middle of their third
semester.
</em>
</blockquote>

<p class="dorina">

 Ouch!  Hopefully my co-advisors will be appropriately reprimanded for
mistakenly focusing my efforts on developing basic understanding of my
research area and fundamental skills, instead of getting me to do some
quick pseudo-original-research.  I was told that we'd be focusing on
learning to speak and potty training next semester, but we'll have to
reassess these plans at our next meeting.

</p>
<p class="dorina">
Until then, I hope <a href="kleene.html">this video</a> will be enough
to demonstrate my potential to deserve a semester extension on the
qualifiers deadline.
</p>
<p class="dorina">
I'm also working on a tutorial on <a href="strings.html">strings in
    Rust</a>, and contributed to
    a <a href="http://www.dori-mic.org">textbook on theoretical computer science</a>.
